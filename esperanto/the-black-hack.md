## What’s this?

The Black Hack (TBH) is a traditional tabletop roleplaying game, played with paper, pencils and dice - it uses that Original 1970s Fantasy Roleplaying Game as a base. But it adds and takes away elements to make it a distinct streamlined flavour of the original roleplaying game.

## The core mechanic

Everything a character might possibly attempt that could result in failure is resolved by testing attribute stats, in order to successfully test a stat - a player must roll ***below*** it on a d20.

Monsters don’t make tests - a character must avoid their attacks by making a test, the only time a monster would roll is for damage.

## Rolling stats

**Stats** are generated with 3d6 in the following order **Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Charisma (CHA)**. If a stat of 15+ is rolled the next must be rolled with 2d6 + 2, then continue with 3d6 until the end or another 15+ is rolled. Once all stats are generated 2 may be swapped around.

## Choose a class

There are 4 choices. Warrior, Cleric, Conjurer, Thief - your class determines how much damage you do, your Hit Points and unique abilities.

## Buy equipment

Every new character starts with 3d6 x 10 coins with which to buy their equipment. They also start with a set of clothes and a one handed weapon as allowed by their class.

## Armor points

Armor provides protection by reducing all incoming damage. Each type will reduce damage by a limited amount. **Armor Points** are regained after a character rests. Once the player or monster has used armor to absorb its maximum amount, they are too tired or wounded to make effective use of it again - they then begin taking full damage.

|     Type     | Points |
|:------------:|:------:|
|   Gambeson   |   2    |
|   Leather    |   4    |
|  Chain Mail  |   6    |
| Plate & Mail |   8    |
| Small shield |   2    |
| Large shield |   4    |

Monsters have 1 point of armor for every **HD** above 1, to figure this out quickly simply -1 from their **HD** - They can also carry shields. (All to a maximum of 10)

## Armor proficiency

If a character wears armor that is not listed in their class, they add their total **Armor points** (despite how many they have used) to any rolls to **Attack** or **Avoid Damage**.

## Converting saves

The Black Hack ignores saves and instead asks the player to roll attribute tests when any spell, trap or effect would impact them - using the below as a guide. Remember the advice in the **Powerful Opponents** section.

|                  STR                   |                 DEX                 |            CON            |
|:--------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Physical Harm that *cannot* be dodged. | Physical Harm that *can* be dodged. | Poison, Disease or Death. |

|             INT             |           WIS            |        CHA        |
|:---------------------------:|:------------------------:|:-----------------:|
| Resisting Spells and Magic. | Deception and Illusions. | Charming effects. |

## Players turn

During a player’s turn a character may move and perform an action. They could attack, look for a clue, talk with an NPC, cast a spell - interacting with the world is an action. Often they will test their attributes to determine the outcome.

## Time & turns

There are 2 important types of tracked time - **Moments** (*rounds*) and **Minutes** (*turns*). **Moments** are used during combat and fast paced scenes of danger and **Minutes** are used when exploring and adventuring. A GM may advance the clock as they need substituting **Minutes** for **Hours**, **Days** or even **Months** should the adventure require it.

## Movement & distance

Rather than track precise numbers, TBH uses 4 abstract ranges for measuring distances. **Close**, **Nearby**, **Far-Away** and **Distant**. On their turn every character can move somewhere **Nearby** as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of the move. They can forgo their action and move somewhere **Far-Away** instead. Anything beyond **Far-Away** can be classified as **Distant** and would take 3 moves to get to.

This system is designed to support the narrative ‘theatre of the mind’ style of play, and is less concerned about tracking squares and fiddly distances. For converting existing movement rates or measures (for spells or areas of effect) use the following as a guide :

|  CLOSE  |  NEARBY  |  FAR AWAY  |
|:-------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| 0 - 5ft | 5 - 60ft | 60 - 120ft |

## Initiative

When combat breaks out, everyone must be sorted into an order so they each get to act and react in turn. Every character tests their **DEX**, those that succeed, take their turn before their opponents, they must then act as a group - deciding their own order for actions. Those that fail their **DEX** tests, go after their opponents.

## Monster HD

**HD** represents a monster's level and the number of d8 rolled to determine its HP.


## Attacking, defending & damage

When a character attacks a creature they must roll below their **STR** stat for a **Melee Attack** or **DEX** for a **Ranged Attack**. Likewise, when a creature attacks, the character must roll below its **STR** against a Melee Attack and **DEX** against a Ranged Attack to avoid taking damage. A GM will often give the stat required for the test.

The damage an attack deals is based on the character’s class or the number of **HD** a monster has.

To make a **Melee Attack** an opponent must be **Close**. **Ranged Attacks** against **Close** opponents are possible, but the attacker suffers a **Disadvantage**.

**Monsters** deal damage based on their **HD** - *refer to the table opposite*, but if you’d prefer to use the damage stats listed in a module that you are playing, you can certainly do that instead.

## Two handed weapons

Larger, more deadly weapons are handled simply by adding +2 to any dice rolled with them. They deal additional damage, but are also harder to hit with.

## Critical damage

If a player making an attack rolls a 1, they double the result of the damage dice they roll. If they roll a 20 when avoiding an attack, they take double damage. **Armor Points** are used normally.

| Monster HD |     Damage     |
|:----------:|:--------------:|
|     1      |     d4 (2)     |
|     2      |     d6 (3)     |
|     3      |    2d4 (4)     |
|     4      |    d10 (5)     |
|     5      |    d12 (6)     |
|     6      |  d6 + d8 (7)   |
|     7      |    2d8 (8)     |
|     8      |    3d6 (9)     |
|     9      |   2d10 (10)    |
|     10     | d10 + d12 (11) |

## Death & dying

When a character is reduced to zero **Hit Points (HP)** they are taken **Out of Action (OofA)**, they are unconscious and cannot make any actions. When the fight is over/are out of danger, a character that is taken **OofA** can roll on the table (*following page*) to see what happens to them. **If they survive they gain 1d4 HP**.

*If the characters lose the fight or are unable to recover the body of the character, they are lost forever!*

## Powerful opponents

For every **HD** above the character’s level, add +1 to every roll the player makes for any attribute test that would determine the outcome of a conflict between them and an NPC. *- A level 3 character defending against a HD 5 monsters attack would add +2 to their roll*.

## Healing

Characters can gain Hit Points from Spells, Potions, and Abilities. They can never gain more than their maximum - and can never go below zero either. When healing a character who is **OofA**, just start at zero and count up. That character is now back on their feet and no longer **OofA**.

| OUT | OF ACTION                                                           |
|:---:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **KO’d** - Just knocked out.                                        |
|  2  | **Fat Head** - Disadvantage on all tests for the next hour.         |
|  3  | **Cracked Bones** - STR, DEX and CON are temp. -2 for the next day. |
|  4  | **Crippled** - STR or DEX is permanently reduced by 2               |
|  5  | **Disfigured** - CHA reduced to 4.                                  |
|  6  | **Dead** - Not alive anymore.                                       |

## Advantage & disadvantage

A GM may decide that a particular course of action or task has a higher or lower chance of success. They will ask a player to roll an additional d20 when making a test - with **advantage** the lower result is used and with **disadvantage**, the higher.

## Resting

When characters rest for about an hour, they regain the use of all their Armor points. Also once per day, after resting, they may roll a **Hit Die** associated with their class and regain that many **HP**.

## Experience

Adventurers learn through defeating and overcoming obstacles. Killing one boring Kobold won’t bring a revelation of learning to someone. Surviving a dungeon, completing a quest or simply living to tell the tale are the things that bring perspective and growth. The old experience system has been completely discarded.

For every session / dungeon level / quest / major event the character survives they gain a level.

*The GM will decide which, and it’s recommended that this decision remains more or less a constant throughout the campaign - and a GM should be clear and upfront with the players so they know where the ‘goalposts’ are.*

## Gaining levels

When a character levels up, their maximum **Hit Points** increase by rolling the **Hit Die** for the class. Also a player should roll a d20 for each **Stat**, if the result is higher - that **Stat** increases by 1.

## Encumbrance

A character can carry a number of items equal to their **STR** with no issues. Carrying over this amount means they are encumbered and all attribute tests are taken with **Disadvantage** - you can also only ever move to somewhere **Nearby**. They simply cannot carry more than double their **STR**.

## Class weapons

When using a weapon not listed in their class, combat tests have Disadvantage.

## Random encounters

The GM should roll a d4 every 15 minutes of real world play (you *are* paying attention, right?) A result of 1-2 means the players will encounter a randomly generated creature or distraction in the following **Minutes** (turn).

## Creature reactions

Some monsters and NPCs will have predetermined personalities and goals that will guide a GM when choosing their actions and feelings towards the characters. Those that do not, such as randomly encountered creatures, make a **Reaction roll** on the following table :

| Roll | Reaction                     |
|:-----|:-----------------------------|
| 1    | Flee then roll again.        |
| 2    | Avoid the PCs entirely.      |
| 3    | Trade with PCs.              |
| 4    | Give the PCs aid.            |
| 5    | Mistake the PCs for friends. |
| 6    | Trick the PCs (roll again)   |
| 7    | Call for Reinforcements.     |
| 8    | Capture/Kill/Eat the PCs.    |

## Banishing undead

Clerics can attempt to banish all nearby undead as an action. They must successfully test their **WIS** for each group of creatures they are attempting to banish, adding the creature's **HD** to the roll. A GM will determine which creatures are in any particular group.

Undead monsters that are **Banished** by Clerics must spend all their movement (and convert actions to movement) to move away from the Cleric for 2d4 **Moments** after being **Banished**.

## Usage die

Any item listed in the equipment section that has a **Usage die** is considered a consumable, limited item. When that item is used the next **Minute** (turn) its **Usage die** is rolled. If the roll is 1-2 then the usage die is downgraded to the next lower die in the following chain:

**d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4**

When you roll a 1-2 on a d4 the item is expended and the character has no more of it left.

## Magic items

Magic weapons typically add +1 to any attribute being tested whilst using the weapon and +1 to each damage dice rolled. More powerful weapons (+2/3) can be found if the GM includes them.

Magic Armor doubles the amount of AP armor would normally have, for example Magic Chain Mail has 12 **Armor Points**. They operate per the normal **Armor Points** rules.

Traditional OSR games deal with magic items by adding +1 or +2 to attack rolls and AC. If the GM intends to give out stronger magic armor (+2/3) to high level players, carefully consider tripling the **Armor Points**.

-----

## Spellcasting

Conjurers and Clerics have the ability to cast spells that are chosen from their appropriate class list (on the following pages).

They can cast any spell they know by reading from their spellbook or can memorise a number of spells equal to their **Level** and cast those without it.

They have a number of 'spell slots' they can cast each day - as shown in the two tables opposite. These represent a magic user's 'energy' and the taxing nature of casting spells over a long period. When they run out of spell slots, they cannot cast any more spells.

Once a spell is cast the Cleric/Conjurer must test their **WIS/INT** - adding the spell's level to the roll. If they fail then they reduce the number of 'spell slots' corresponding to the spell level just cast by 1. When a memorised spell is cast it is not forgotten.

After roughly ***8 hours rest***, the number of 'spell slots' a character has refreshes to its maximum.

If a spell from a traditional OSR or original era game calls for a creature to make a save, the character must test their **INT** or **WIS** - to see if the magic cast was powerful enough to overcome their defences (remember the **Powerful Opponents** rule).

## Example of play

**DM :** So you're in the sewer, knee deep in muck, it's dark and to the north there's a portcullis, what do you want to do?
**Thief :** Is the portcullis Nearby?
**DM :** Yeah.
**Thief :** I'll move to it and as my action I’ll check it for traps.
**Warrior :** Assuming it's safe, I want to bend the bars.
**Conjurer :** And I want to cast light on my staff.
**DM :** Ok, Thief, test your Wisdom by rolling a d20 under your WIS score - to check the portcullis for traps.
**Thief :** \*rolls\* Made it!
**DM :** You're confident it's free of anything designed to do you harm, Warrior, still want to bend the bars? If so test your Strength!
**Warrior :** \*rolls\* Piece of cake!
**DM :** Good stuff, now Conjurer, you cast Light on your staff. That's a level 1 spell right?
**Conjurer :** Yup.
**DM :** Ok, well test your Intelligence and add one to your d20 roll, if you fail you lose a level one spell slot for the rest of the day.
**Conjurer :** \*rolls\* I need to roll under, not on it, right?
**DM :** That's right.
**Conjurer :** Damn, I failed.
**DM :** Unlucky! Beyond the bent iron bars is a long dark sewer tunnel heading deep down. What do you want to do?
**Warrior :** Explore down the tunnel..?
**Thief :** Agreed! I'll sneak ahead.
**Conjurer :** And I’ll protect the rear!
**DM :** Ok Thief, you move down the sewer, still Nearby to your friends, please test your Dexterity to see how quiet you are - remember you get Advantage on tests when sneaking, roll two d20's and choose the result you like.
**Thief :** \*rolls\* despite rolling two dice I’ve got a 17 and 19. What are the odds?
**DM :** Ouch. You're making so much noise being sneaky, a Ghoul hiding in the darkness close to you leaps and attacks!
**Thief :** Bugger!
**DM :** Initiative time! Everyone test their Dexterity, passing means you act before the Ghoul, failing means you go after. Thief you test with Disadvantage.
**Warrior :** I go before.
**Conjurer :** I'm after.
**DM :** Thief?
**Thief :** How long was it to roll up a character again? I go after.
**Warrior :** I want to run down the sewer and smash the Ghoul with my Broadsword.
**DM :** Ok Warrior, you move Close to the Ghoul. Test your Strength to see if you hit it, you should add +1 to the roll, as the Ghoul's a powerful opponent.
**Warrior :** \*rolls\* Rolled a 7! \*rolls again\* So that's 8HP damage.
**DM :** Good hit! Now the Ghoul's turn. Thief test your Dexterity to try and dodge the Ghoul's paralysing claws and bite. Remember the +1.
**Thief :** \*rolls\* Ugh! 18.
**DM :** Oh dear. You feel a painful numbing sensation run through your body. Test your Constitution, if you fail the Ghoul paralyses you.
**Thief :** \*rolls\* Do I add the +1 to this too?
**DM :** Yes. Conjurer, you see the Thief fall rigid to the floor, what do you do?
**Conjurer :** I'll start backing away slowly.
**Thief :** I'll get you in the next life you git!
